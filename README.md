# Welcome to My Portfolio Repository! :wave:

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio. If you find it interesting or helpful, feel free to **fork** this repository and use it as a starting point for your own portfolio! :fork_and_knife:

Please note that the project section in this portfolio was inspired by the amazing work of Brittany Chiang. Her portfolio served as a great source of inspiration for me. :star2:

Remember, while it's great to draw inspiration from others' work, always try to add your own unique touch to make it truly yours! Happy coding! :computer:
